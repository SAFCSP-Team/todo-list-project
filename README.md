# Todo List Project

### Objective
In this project, our main goal is to create a project that combines control flow, functions, and lists, to make sure can pass the first part of Python 101.

### Problem
create a program that allows the user to manage a simple to-do list. It includes functions like adding, removing, and displaying tasks.


### Implementation
- Write a function `add_task` to add a task to the list. The function takes the name of the list and the new task as input.
- Write a function `remove_task` to remove a task from the list. The function takes the name of the list and the task as input and checks if the task is in the list or not.
- Write a function `display` to print all the tasks in the list. Using the for loop.
- Write a while loop


```python

```
